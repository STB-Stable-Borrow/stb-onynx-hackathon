      "Stable Coin(STC) is STB’s native XRC 20 token built on XDC Network; it's similar to ERC 20 token on Ethereum. STC is a collateral-backed XRC 20 token it attempts to maintain a stable 1:1 value with the U.S dollar by locking XDC as collateral through STB unique lending protocol. It maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars or centralized entities, but by using collateralized debt in XDC. Locked XDC proves STC is fully backed and worthy to be tied to $1, since locking of collateral is risky due to price fluctuations of the collateral, the over collateralized mechanism ensures that STC is still overpaid for and worth more than total STC lent out, when the price of the collateral goes down and the collateralization ratio of XDC to STC is lower than appropriate, the vault containing that loan is in Liquidation and the regulatory protocol ensure this is dealt with and the locked collateral is taken in place to back STC and will be use to buy STC to ensure it's stability. Why STC? List of what makes STC unique and better:",

      ` Borrowers are STB users that borrow STC against XDC in an over collateralized manner and
      the deposited XDC is locked.
      When borrowers borrow on STB they create a vault which keeps various records, part of
      the record is total locked collateral(XDC) as well as total debt(STC).Borrowers can view all
      their vaults and deposit more collateral to them if they want. Locked collateral can not be
      withdrawn unless partial or full payment of the debt is made.Borrowers have maximum
      number of vaults they are allowed to create; it cannot be less than 10 but can be more
      depending on what the platform decides which will be overseen by STB Dao.
      Borrowers can decide to over deposit Collateral when creating a vault for vault safety; the
      overpaid collateral is available for withdrawal anytime if the vault is not in liquidation. On
      the other hand if the vault is in liquidation, the overpayment is locked up and not available
      for withdrawal. If the addition of previous locked collateral and the overpayment is enough
      to make the vault active, the vault will be kept active if not the vault will be liquidated and
      closed.Over payment is only allowed when creating a vault after a vault as been created all
      deposited collateral will be locked up and not available for withdrawal unless full or partial
      repayment is done.`,

      don't lock you out of your vault`,
      `5) Have it in mind that when your vault is in Liquidation you can't do anything about it
      so you can only prevent liquidation.After your vault has been liquidated by an
      haunter 10% of half the amount of STC you borrowed in $ will be given to the
      haunter in equivalent XDC and if after converting your locked XDC (minus the
      equivalent XDC to $ given to the haunter) to STC; if it is more than what you owe
      90% of the remaining(after outstanding debt has been removed) will be sent to
      you,10% will be sent to STB as liquidation penalty.`,

      easily be calculated in $ and they get paid in equivalent XDC.
